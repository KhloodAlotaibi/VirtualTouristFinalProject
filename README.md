# Udacity Final Project: Virtual Tourist iOS Developer Nanodegree

## Project Overview
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

The app has two view controller scenes.
- Travel Locations Map View: Allows the user to drop pins around the world.
- Photo Album View: Allows the users to download and edit an album for a location.

## Usage 
- Open “VirtualTourist.xcodeproj” file on Xcode.
- Run the app using your phone or iOS simulator.
- Tap and hold to drop pins as many as you want on the map.
- You can delete the pins by tapping the delete button at the top right corner.
- Tap on the pin to show photos from that location.
- Tap on the new collection button at the bottom of the page to show more photos.
- Tap on any photo to delete it.
